The dataset name "lhakobe", "lkyan", "lkatabami" was taken with high magnification(1000X).
The dataset name "shakobe", "skyan", "skatabami" was taken with small magnification(40X).
The dataset name "thakobe", "tkyan", "tkatabami" was taken with about magnification 800X. This magnification, 800X is not sure.

You can train and make the model though also you can load the model and use it.
The model name "my_model_ll2s.pth" is maken by learning high magnification image
The model name "my_model_perfect.pth" is make by learing magnification 800X image
I didn't prepare the model maken by learning low magnification image, so please train and make it by yourself

1. Follow the instructions from the code, classification_interactive, and run it and make sure it is working.


Please DM me any errors or problem with instructions. I will do my best to help you out.
